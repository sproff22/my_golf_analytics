# My Golf Analytics
An analytical deep dive into my god-awful golf game

## Overview
I suck at golf. According to the USGA, I am currently a 20.6 handicap. This means that even on my best days, I still average worse than a bogey on a given hole. My goal is to become a 15 handicap. Better yet, I'd prefer to reach that milestone before my dad, who also sucks but does manage to practice more than me.

I would love to get better, but that takes lots of time and effort. Given I work full-time during the day, take classes in the evening, like to travel, and do all these other random things, it is not realistic to think that I could somehow quickly improve my golf game by 5 strokes.

The golf swing is only part of the game. Course management and understanding strategy is a major part of scoring, and getting this is often how high handicaps see improvement. I thought: What if I can use data about my game to get a better understanding of where I gain strokes, or more likely lose strokes, and use my data science background to come up with a gameplan to get me to a 15?

I track all my rounds on 18 Birdies, which allows me to keep stats on my fairways, greens, chips, and putts per round. It also has each hole's handicap rating, allowing me to see how I fare on the easiest and hardest holes on the course.

Using this data, and a little bit more that I'll get to, I set out to better understand my golf game, and hopefully come away with a gameplan to get me to a 15 handicap.

## About This Repository

My full writeup is available in HTML form. Additionally, the jupyter lab notebook I used will be available in order to view my code. 

## Notes

I use 18 birdies to track my stats, and they do not have any API. I manually inputted all my data for this project. If you would like to mimic this analysis and have a better tracking system, feel free to adjyst the code accordingly to automate the data ingest process.

I know there are lots of types of golf tracking equipment out there which I do not have. Club sensors, shot tracking, etc. would all add lots to this analysis!
